<H2><A NAME=SECTION00031000000000000000>2.1 What are spices</A></H2>
<P>
Spices are the various strongly flavoured or aromatic substances of
vegetable origin, commonly used as condiments or employed for other
purposes on account of their fragance and preservation qualities
[<A HREF="spices.html#oed">1</A>].
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00032000000000000000>2.2 Why are spices so tasty?</A></H2>
<P>
Spices have two main components [<A HREF="spices.html#Pruthi">2</A>]:
<P>
<UL><LI> Volatile oils. Also known as essential oils, they are
  responsible for the characteristic aroma of spices. 
<LI> Oleoresins, or non volatile extracts, which are responsible for
  the typical taste and flavour.
</UL><H2><A NAME=SECTION00033000000000000000>2.3 What is the difference between essential oils and oleoresins?</A></H2>
<P>
By David Soknacki, from Econ Manufacturing:
<P>
<blockquote> <em> ``Essential oils are generally produced by injecting the
    spice bed with steam, and then separating the distillate into the
    essential oil and water. On the other hand oleoresins are produced
    by soaking spices in a solvent, whether a combination of ethanol
    and water in your example for vanilla, or hexane in the case of
    many of our spices. One of the final stages in processing is to
    remove the solvent to acceptable levels (35
    ethanol for vanilla, but under 25ppm for hexane in spices). What
    is left are all of the flavour components dissolved by the
    solvent.  Companies decide between essential oils and oleoresins
    usually depending on the flavour profile they require for their
    finished product.''  </em>

<H2><A NAME=SECTION00035000000000000000>2.5 What are some uses of spices (excluding the kitchen)</A></H2>
<P>
Some examples on the use of spices:
<P>
<UL><LI> Antioxygenic properties. Some spices retard the oxydation of
  fat.
<LI> Preserving action. 
  Some spices contain essential oils that are toxic to microorganisms [<A HREF="spices.html#Pruthi">2</A>]:
  <UL><LI> Cloves contain plenty of essential oil (15 to 20%); its main
    component --eugenol, 80 to 92%-- inhibits the growth of
    microorganisms. 
  <LI> At normal growth temperatures, the mustard's essential oil is
    toxic to microorganism.
  </UL>
<LI> Antimicrobial activity. 
   Black pepper, garlic,  cinnamon, nutmeg,
  cloves, ginger, cumin, and caraway amongst others, are used in
  India for correcting and a variety of intestinal disorders

wild in north Burma and the hills of Assam.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00043000000000000000>3.3 Where the name pepper comes from</A></H2>

According to Pruthi [<A HREF="spices.html#Pruthi">2</A>], there are several methods to prepare it:
<P>
<OL><LI> Water steeping and rotting technique
  <UL><LI> From ripening fresh berries. It is the oldest method. Fresh
    berries are harvested when one or two berries start turning yellow
    or red. There are submerged for several days, at the eleventh the
    skin is removed by hand or mechanical methods. The berries
    --without skin-- are washed and immerse in a bleaching solution.
    After 2 days, then they are washed and dried.
  <LI> From dried berries. Pepper berries are dried for 7 to 10 days,
    then submerged for one or two weeks. Again they are washed,
    bleached, washed and dried.
  </UL>
<LI> Steaming. Ripening green berries are steamed for 10 to 15
  minutes, then a machine removes the skin. Also, the berries are
  treated with a bleaching solution, then washed and dried.

<P>
<LI> Decortication technique (also known as <i>decorticated
    pepper</i>) . Created by decortication machines that remove the skin
  of the dried black peppercorns. 
</OL><H2><A NAME=SECTION00046000000000000000>3.6 What is pink pepper?</A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00047000000000000000>3.7 Are there any differences between white and black pepper?</A></H2>
<P>
The only significant difference between white and black pepper is in
starch and fiber content. <em> The belief that white pepper is milder
  in flavour than black pepper does not seem to be confirmed by the
  scientific data</em> [<A HREF="spices.html#Pruthi">2</A>]. However, there are some
differences in pungency --of black and white pepper-- due to
geographical origin.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00048000000000000000>3.8 Storage</A></H2>
<P>
Pepper can be washed and re-dried before grinding. Store away from
sunlight at moderate temperatures and low humidity. Only ground
pepper needs to be stored in sealed containers.

<P>
  <img src="http://csgwww.uwaterloo.ca/~dmg/faqs/spices/gifs/vanilla_16.gif"><p>

<P>
Vanilla is the fully grown fruit of the orchid <em> Vanilla
  fragrans</em> 
harvested before it is fully ripe; then it is fermented and cured. The
fruits are usually referred to as vanilla beans [<A HREF="spices.html#Purseglove2">5</A>].
Vanilla production is regulated by ISO standard 5565.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00061000000000000000>5.1 Where does Vanilla come from?</A></H2>
<P>
Vanilla is native to Mexico, Guatemala and other parts of Central
America. At the present time, it grows also in Madagascar, the
Seychelles, Tahiti, Réunion and other tropical areas[<A HREF="spices.html#Mulherin">4</A>].
The first recorded use of the spice in European literature dates back
to 1520, when Moctezuma II offered vanilla flavoured chocolate to
Hernán Cortés. However, the use of <em> tlilxochitl</em> (Nahuatl for
vanilla) is earlier documented in the precolumbian literature.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00062000000000000000>5.2 What is Vanillin?</A></H2>
<P>
Vanillin is a crystalline phenolic aldehyde C_8H_8O_3 that is the
chief fragrant component of vanilla and is used especially in flavouring and
in perfumery [<A HREF="spices.html#Webster">6</A>].
<P>
Vanillin can now be produced synthetically, and it is much cheaper
than natural vanilla.

<P>
<A NAME=vanillaextract>&#160;</A>
Vanilla extract is obtained by macerating the cured beans in a
solution of water and alcohol. It might contain sugar or glycerine as
sweeteners or thickeners [<A HREF="spices.html#Purseglove2">5</A>].
<P>
Conventional vanilla extracts have a minimum ethanol content of 35%,
and contain the soluble extractives from 1 part by weight of vanilla
beans in 10 parts by volume of hydroalcoholic solution.
[<A HREF="spices.html#Purseglove2">5</A>].
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00063200000000000000>5.3.2 How do I differentiate between real and unreal vanilla
  extract?</A></H3>
<P>
``The two best indicators of pure vanilla extract are alcohol content
and price.  The alcohol content must be at least 35%; synthetics
usually have no alcohol or at most, about 2%. Any purchases that cost
less than US$25.00 a quart are most likely
synthetic.''[<A HREF="spices.html#patriciarain">7</A>]

<P>
<A NAME=vanillaflavouring>&#160;</A>
It is similar to vanilla extract (see <A HREF="spices.html#vanillaextract">5.3.1</A>) but
contains less than 35% of ethanol per volume.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00063400000000000000>5.3.4 What is vanilla tincture?</A></H3>
<P>
It is used exclusively in pharmaceutical applications. It is prepared
by maceration from 1 part of vanilla beans by weight to 10 parts of
hydroalcoholic solution and contains added sugar. It differs from
vanilla extract (see <A HREF="spices.html#vanillaextract">5.3.1</A>) by having at least a 38%
ethanol content.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00063500000000000000>5.3.5 What is concentrated vanilla extract and concentrated vanilla
  flavouring?</A></H3>

They are prepared by removing the solvent from their
regular counterparts (see <A HREF="spices.html#vanillaextract">5.3.1</A>,
<A HREF="spices.html#vanillaflavouring">5.3.3</A>).
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00063600000000000000>5.3.6 What is Vanilla Oleoresin?</A></H3>
<P>
It is a semi-solid concentrate obtained by removing the solvent from
the vanilla extract. A solution of isopropanol is frequently used
instead of ethanol for the maceration. Vanilla oleoresin has lost 
part of its aroma --hence its flavour-- during the removal of the
solvent.

Similar to vanilla extract (see <A HREF="spices.html#vanillaextract">5.3.1</A>) but prepared
with perfumery alcohol, with near 90% ethanol content. It is not
intended for consumption.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION000631000000000000000>5.3.10 What is Vanilla Absolute?</A></H3>
<P>
It is the most concentrated form of vanilla. ``It is 7-13 times stronger

<P>
It is supplied in 5 grades (or 7 if intermediate grades are included)
of whole beans and in the form of cuts. The top grades of Mexican
beans are rarely ``frosted'' with a surface coating of naturally
exuded vanillin.[<A HREF="spices.html#Purseglove2">5</A>]

<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00064700000000000000>5.4.7 What is Tahiti vanilla?</A></H3>
<P>
It is obtained from <em> V. tahitensis</em> and ``possesses a

than true vanilla.'' [<A HREF="spices.html#Purseglove2">5</A>]. It generally has less
flavour than true vanilla.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00064800000000000000>5.4.8 What is Vanillons (Guadeloupe vanilla or Antilles vanilla)?</A></H3>
<P>
It is obtained from <em> V. pompona</em>. ``Vanillons has a low vanillin
content and possesses a characteristic floral aroma, bearing
similarities to Tahiti vanilla'' [<A HREF="spices.html#Purseglove2">5</A>]. It has a poor
flavour and it is normally used in perfumery.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00064900000000000000>5.4.9 Is it safe to buy Mexican vanilla?</A></H3>
<P>
Mexican vanilla has one of the finest aromas, however, most of the
vanilla extract sold in Mexico is artificial. In México there is almost a
complete lack of enforcement of labeling laws for vanilla.
Furthermore, nowhere in the world you can expect to buy a liter of
real vanilla extract for a couple of dollars. As a good example of
this kind of problems, I have seen turmeric being sold as saffron in a
well known supermarket. So don't be cheap: if you want good vanilla,
pay the price of getting it from a reliable source; if you care for
price, use artificial vanilla.

<P>
Juan San Mames shared the following recipe [<A HREF="spices.html#sanmames">9</A>]:
<P>
<blockquote> <em>
Use one vanilla bean for every 120 ml.  of any clear liquor (vodka 
preferably). With a knife, split the bean open  (always put your 
finger behind the knife). If the bean is hard, just break it into pieces. 
Then  put the bean in the liquor.
<P>
Close the bottle and leave it for about two weeks or until the vanilla
bean aroma begins to come through.
<P>
When you use the extract, if you don't want the vanilla seeds to show  
with the ingredients, use a coffee filter. You can return the 
seeds to the bottle.  If you make ice cream, you may want to show the 
seeds in the finished ice cream.</em>
<P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Bruce Steinberg added [<A HREF="spices.html#bruce">10</A>]:
<P>
<blockquote> <em>
You can shake the bottle several times a week to accelerate the
extraction. Brandy may also be used for interesting variations.</em>
</blockquote>
<P>
According to US regulations, 1 l. of vanilla extract must contain a
minimum of 100 gr. of vanilla beans (I reckon that each
  regular size complete bean must weight between 3 and 5 gr.) of no
more or 25% moisture content. Commercial extracts also include sugar
and glycerine, to help to ``fix'' the aroma [<A HREF="spices.html#Purseglove2">5</A>].

<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00071000000000000000>6.1 What is saffron?</A></H2>
<P>
Saffron is the dried stigmas of the crocus sativus.  It is of orange
color and has a strong perfume and a bitter taste.  Saffron production
is regulated by ISO with standard 3632.
<P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00072000000000000000>6.2 Why is saffron so expensive?</A></H2>
<P>
Every plant has on average 3 flowers; each flower only 3 stigmas.  It
takes between 200,000 and 300,000 stigmas to make 1 kg. of saffron
[<A HREF="spices.html#Mulherin">4</A>]. Pure saffron, however, has a strong flavour and a
pinch is sufficient for most dishes.

<H1><A NAME=SECTION00080000000000000000>7 What is coriander/cilantro/Chinese parsley?</A></H1>
<P>
Coriander is the common name for coriandrum sativum (fam.
umbelliferae). It is an annual plant similar to parsley. It has
erect, furrowed solid, branched stems. The alternate bright green
leaves are pinnate or bipinnate, the lower ones are broader leaflets
than the upper ones, which are finely divided.
Coriander seeds are cream to brown spheres of 1-1.5 mm. in
diameter. In the culinary argot, it is common to refer to the plant as
cilantro and to the seeds as coriander.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00081000000000000000>7.1 Where does the name coriander comes from?</A></H2>
<P>
&quot;There is uncertainty about the [source of the ]generic name,
Coriandrum; it might be derived from the Greek word &quot;koris&quot; (= bug), a
reference perhaps to the plant's smell and the apperance of the
fruits.''  [<A HREF="spices.html#herbs">12</A>]

<UL><LI> ``bouquet'' in the fridge. Cover loosely with plastic. 
<LI> ``bouquet'' in the window.
<LI> ``airtight container'' in the fridge. 
<LI> ``wrapping'' in damp towels, inside a plastic bag.
</UL>

You can probably find coconut milk in an Asian store, either in liquid
or powdered form. If you have no other choice, you can follow this
recipe [<A HREF="spices.html#ashall">13</A>]:
<P>
<blockquote> <em>

    <LI>  Strain the coconut shreds
      and press them in the bottom of the strainer get as much liquid as possible.

</blockquote><H1><A NAME=SECTION000100000000000000000>9 Storing Spices</A></H1>
<P>
3 factors affect the quality of stored spices:
<P>
<UL><LI> Light. Spices containing color pigments (such as capsicums, saffron,
  green cardamoms, turmeric) and chorophyll (dryed herbs) need
  protection from light. For instance, the color of capsicums is mostly
  due to carotenoids, which are photosensitive and oxidate in the
  presence of light.
<LI> Humidity. Since most spices are sold dry, they tend to attract water
  and mold.
<LI> Oxygen. The essential oil of spices oxydates in the presence of 
  atmospheric oxygen, specially at high temperatures. However, most
  whole spices are protected by a pericarp and their natural
  antioxidants which they contain. 
</UL>
<P>

<P>
Torricelli (cited in [<A HREF="spices.html#Pruthi">2</A>]), studied
the loss of essential oil in the following spices: anise, cardamon,
coriander, fennel, cumin, sweet marjoram, mace, cloves, pepper,
allspice, and cinnamon. When the spices where kept in small paper bags
(containing 1 to 5g), in the dark for 5 years, they lost 47% essential
oil on the average. In case of powder spices, they lost an average of
62% and up to 90%. The same spices, when kept, during six years in
dark glass containers, lost 24% of their essential oils on the
average. When the containers were hermetic, and the spice filled the
container, the loss was from 0 to 5%, whether the spice was powdered
or whole.
<P>
So keep your spices in dark, sealed containers. Fill each container
completely. Put them in a fresh place (some people use the fridge, see <A HREF="spices.html#secstorfridge">9.1</A>) and
away from light.  And your spices will long enough (whatever that
means to you).

<H2><A NAME=SECTION000101000000000000000>9.1 Should I store my spices in the fridge?</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME=secstorfridge>&#160;</A>
Some people store spices inside the fridge. The
fridge keeps the spices in a dark, low temperature environment, hence
protecting them from light and rapid oxidation. There is only one
problem, whenever you open the spice container, humidity immediately
condenses on the surface of the spice and the container, then you
close the container and the moisture is kept captive. Humidity is a
natural enemy of most dry spices.
<P>
The fridge suits the bill if you do keep big containers there, from
which you regularly fill small-daily use ones. Nonetheless, for the
majority of the spices, it is more practical to buy small amounts of
each spice every once in a while, which in effect, guarantees their
freshness.
<P>
Some people freeze small sealed envelopes, each one storing a
``dose''. Therefore, they don't have the condensation problem.

<H2><A NAME=SECTION000102000000000000000>9.2 Bay leaves</A></H2>
<P>
Bay leaves lose approximately 30% of their volatile oil and 40-60%
of their chlorophyll during one year of storage.  A good way to
evaluate the quality of the leaf is to determine how bright its color
is.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION000103000000000000000>9.3 Ground spices</A></H2>
<P>
Ground spices, with greater surface exposed, tend to lose their
volatile oils. They also deteriorate faster than whole spices.
<P>
The needs for packaging vary  from spice to spice. In general, follow
the next guidelines:
<P>
<UL><LI> Use dark, air tight containers.
<LI> Fill the container as much as you can.
<LI> Avoid buying ground spices. Grind them yourself using a
  mortar.
