By David Soknacki, from Econ Manufacturing:

<blockquote> <em><#29#> ``Essential oils are generally produced by injecting the
    spice bed with steam, and then separating the distillate into the
    essential oil and water. On the other hand oleoresins are produced
    by soaking spices in a solvent, whether a combination of ethanol
    and water in your example for vanilla, or hexane in the case of
    many of our spices. One of the final stages in processing is to
    remove the solvent to acceptable levels (35%
    ethanol for vanilla, but under 25ppm for hexane in spices). What
    is left are all of the flavour components dissolved by the
    solvent.  Companies decide between essential oils and oleoresins
    usually depending on the flavour profile they require for their
    finished product.''  <#29#></em>
