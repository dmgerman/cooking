  extract?</A></H3>


``The two best indicators of pure vanilla extract are alcohol content
and price.  The alcohol content must be at least 35<tex2html_percent_mark>; synthetics
usually have no alcohol or at most, about 2<tex2html_percent_mark>. Any purchases that cost
less than US$25.00 a quart are most likely
synthetic.''[#patriciarain#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1#]
