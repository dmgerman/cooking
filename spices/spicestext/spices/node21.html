Vanilla is native to Mexico, Guatemala and other parts of Central
America. At the present time, it grows also in Madagascar, the
Seychelles, Tahiti, Réunion and other tropical areas[#Mulherin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1#].
The first recorded use of the spice in European literature dates back
to 1520, when Moctezuma II offered vanilla flavoured chocolate to
Hernán Cortés. However, the use of <#81#><em> tlilxochitl</em><#81#> (Nahuatl for
vanilla) is earlier documented in the precolumbian literature.
