The only significant difference between white and black pepper is in
starch and fiber content. <#69#><em> The belief that white pepper is milder
  in flavour than black pepper does not seem to be confirmed by the
  scientific data</em><#69#> [#Pruthi#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1#]. However, there are some
differences in pungency --of black and white pepper-- due to
geographical origin.
