<h1>Frequently Asked Questions about Spices</h1>

There are two versions of the FAQ, each optimized for different
types of WWW browsers.


<ul>
  <li><b><a href="spices.html">Graphic Browsers</a></b>. Each page
       contains a section, and chemical
       equations are displayed as inline pictures.
  <li><b><a href="spices-text.html">Text Browsers</a></b>.
       The whole text is available in a single page, the pictures are
       still inline, but the equations are approximated using ASCII
       text. Specially useful if you have a slow link.
</ul>
