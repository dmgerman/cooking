Hola Daniel, buenos dias.

I am really getting sick of all of this saffron vendors telling people
about
someone else saffron. Please Daniel, note that if you are a vendor of
saffron you must know what the coloring strength of your saffron is and
have a photo spectrometry report.  I have taken samples of saffron to
the
lab and they came at 136 when it should be minimum 190.   All this
people that talk about been on the business all this years etc. and
wacht  out for powder or this and that SHOW ME YOUR PHOTO SPECTROMETRY
REPORT OF YOUR SAFFRON.
According to ISO-3632  the coloring strength of the saffron must clearly
shown outside of the package I AM THE ONLY ONE DOING THIS IN
THE USA. Please read my new page www.saffron.com also for your
information you should have a link to Ellen Szita's page she is the only

person that knows about saffron check out her superb page
www.saffroinfo.com
Feliz Navidad

ps. I am going to Gutierrez Zamora picking up 3.5 Mt of vanilla beans
extra.




 Cathy> Hello Daniel -
  I thought I'd better send this attachment, to help you remember this
 Cathy> communication! My apologies for not writing sooner; May and June were
 Cathy> very busy for me and sometimes when that happens, I end up not getting
 Cathy> around to doing too many things. Anyway, I wanted to send you the
 Cathy> vanilla recipe from my friend, Erasmos Curti, who is a vainillero; he
 Cathy> manages a large vanilla plantation near Papantla. I've reduced the kilos
 Cathy> and litros to ounces and cups - 

 Cathy> Vainilla Extract - 3 & 1/2 ounces vanilla beans
                   2 & 1/4 cup liquor (48% or 96 proof)
                   1 & 1/3 cup water

  Cover vanilla beans with liquor and water; leave for 72 hours at 86
 Cathy> degrees F., then filter. ( I tried this recipe, and decided to leave the
 Cathy> vanilla beans in longer than this.) My friend Rocio tells me to use
 Cathy> these beans again in a lesser amount of liquor and leave for a longer
 Cathy> time to make a second batch. 

  Don Guadalupe, the 87 year old curandero I work with, says you can use
 Cathy> vanilla to warm the body when one is feeling chilled; use 5 - 20 drops
 Cathy> of vanilla tincture (this would be the extract in alcohol) in a glass of
 Cathy> water. Other herbal sources mention vanilla as a stimulant, and for use
 Cathy> against poisons. A source from the year 1615 touts vanilla's diuretic
 Cathy> properties, recommends it for flatulence, and to bring on the menses. 


   Daniel - you mentioned that you might be going to Mexico this year. I
 Cathy> think that Don Guadalupe would be happy to meet you. His home is on a
 Cathy> hill, Cerro de la Jarrana, in Papantla; he lives very simply. He and his
 Cathy> wife share their home with their son and his wife, and their four
 Cathy> children. I think it is a very interesting region, also. There are the
 Cathy> El Tajin ruins nearby, the beach town of Tecolutla about 30 minutes away
 Cathy> by bus, and from there you can take a river trip up the Tecolutla River.
 Cathy> The area and vegetation are tropical. Actually, I am taking a group of
 Cathy> people down in March and April; if you like, I'll send you a brochure
 Cathy> just so you can get a better idea of what we do as a group. I do this to
 Cathy> help support Don Lupe's efforts, to share this information and
 Cathy> experience, and hopefully it pays for my trip. If I make anything over
 Cathy> that, I recycle it somehow back into the community there.
   To answer your question about what I plan to do with this
 Cathy> information, I must tell you that I am not totally certain. Each time I
 Cathy> go, I refine or add to the information gathered previously, so I have
 Cathy> information now on about 60 plants. I share this information with the
 Cathy> local Cultures Populares, where my friend Rocio works; she is an
 Cathy> anthropologist. They have done some work with Don Lupe with the plant
 Cathy> information. There are some local politics which will probably prevent
 Cathy> that from going any farther. If you have any ideas, I'd love to hear
 Cathy> them! Maybe someday I would write something, but it is not in my plans
 Cathy> for now.
   Well, that is a lot of information for you to digest in this busy
 Cathy> holiday season! If you would like me to send you some information, email
 Cathy> me your address and I'll put it in the mail. If you have any questions
 Cathy> about anything, email me back. I will be going back to Mexico January 8
 Cathy> - February 4, then with the group March 23 - April 6. I hope to hear
 Cathy> from you soon! I'm really sorry for my long delay in writing you back!
   I hope you have a Merry Christmas - ! Best regards, Cathy Freyer.
