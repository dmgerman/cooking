Patricia Rain, local Santa Cruz (CA) author of "The Vanilla Cookbook," 
says hi to everyone on rec.food.cooking and sends along the following 
answer to your question, Greg:

To make your own vanilla extract, split open one long bean (may be
cut into pieces) for each 1/2 pint of good quality vodka (rum or
brandy may also be used for interesting variations).  (More beans
may be used for greater strength, as many as six for a quart of vodka, 
brandy, or rum.)

Submerge beans completely in liquid, cap the bottle tightly, and store 
in a cool, dark place.  Allow the liquid to steep with the bean(s) 
for four to six weeks, shaking the bottle several times a week.

Before using, sieve through a strainer lined with cheesecloth (or
use a coffee filter), rinse the bottle to remove residue, and pour    
back into the bottle.  Add one whole vanilla bean and cap tightly
until used. 

That's about it.

BTW, her "Vanilla Cookbook" covers the use of vanilla in everything
from basic extracts through liqueurs, desserts, souffles, and baking
of all kinds, to full-tilt savoury recipes such as "Seafood-Pecan
Salad with Vanilla Mayonnaise," "Rice with Coconut, Vanilla, Dates,
and Lemon" and "Fresh Tuna Grenobleoise with Vanilla"(!).

She plans to be online soon, but meanwhile you can call her at her 
Vanilla Information Hotline at 408/457-0902 (or fax at 408/457-2521) 
with any vanilla questions, to request a basic vanilla FAQ (by fax or
snail mail), or to get further info on ordering Tahitian and Bourbon
beans, extracts, or "The Vanilla Cookbook" itself.  

Hope this helps.
