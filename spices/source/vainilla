Dear Greg:
      Use one vanilla bean for every 4 oz.  of any clear liquor (vodka 
preferably) .   With a knife,  split the bean open  (always put your 
finger behind the knife). If the bean is hard, just break it into pieces. 
 Then  put  the  bean in the liquor.  Close the bottle and leave it  for 
about two weeks or until the vanilla bean aroma begins to come through.  
When you use the extract ,  if you don't want the vanilla seeds  to show  
with the ingredients,   use a coffee filter . After you can return the 
seeds to the bottle.  If you make ice cream, you may want to show the 
seeds in the finished ice cream.
                         You don't have a bean?
Drop us a SASE and we'll send you a FREE vanilla bean, and a drawing on 
how to cut the bean without cutting your finger. Any body else is invited 
also for this offer, just send a SASE.
