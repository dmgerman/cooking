2 SPICES

2.1 What are spices

   Spices are the various strongly flavoured or aromatic substances of
   vegetable origin, commonly used as condiments or employed for other
   purposes on account of their fragance and preservation qualities [1]. 

2.2 Why are spices so tasty?

   Spices have two main components [2]: 

     * Volatile oils. Also known as essential oils, they are responsible
       for the characteristic aroma of spices. 
     * Oleoresins, or non volatile extracts, which are responsible for
       the typical taste and flavour. 

2.3 What are some uses of spices (excluding the kitchen)

   Some examples on the use of spices: 

     * Antioxygenic properties. Some spices retard the oxydation of fat. 
     * Preserving action. Some spices contain essential oils that are
       toxic to microorganisms [2]: 
          + Cloves contain plenty of essential oil (15 to 20%); its main
            component --eugenol, 80 to 92%-- inhibits the growth of
            microorganisms. 
          + At normal growth temperatures, the mustard's essential oil is
            toxic to microorganism. 
     * Antimicrobial activity. Black pepper, garlic, cinnamon, nutmeg,
       cloves, ginger, cumin, and caraway amongst others, are used in
       India for correcting and a variety of intestinal disorders [2]. 
       In a study, Subrahmanyan, et.al [3] reported the susceptibilities
       of E. coli to garlic: at a concentration of 20 mg/ml of garlic,
       the number of organisms per ml. were 17, 22, and 300 after 0, 6,
       and 24 hrs. respectively; for the same periods, at a concentration
       of 0 mg/ml, the results were: 17, 3600, and 16800. 
     * Perfumery and cosmetics. 
          + Oils from cardamon, cumin, celery, chive, juniper, and nutmeg
            are used in different types of perfume [2]. 
          + The oil of cinnamon, dill seed, fennel seed, and nutmeg are
            used in scenting soaps, dental preparations, hair lotions,
            and others [2]. 

3 PEPPER

3.1 What is black pepper?

   Black pepper is the whole dried immature fruit of the Piper nigrum. 

3.2 Where is pepper native from?

   It is native of the Western Ghats in India, where it is still
   restricted as a wild plant. Nowadays, it can also be found growing
   wild in north Burma and the hills of Assam. 

3.3 Where the name pepper comes from

   It is believed that the name comes from the Sanskrit pippali, which
   was the name of the long pepper, P. longum, which is now never seen in
   Europe. 

3.4 What is green pepper?

   It is unripe, but fully developed, pepper which is artificially dried
   or preserved in ``wet'' form, e.g. brine, vinegar, citric acid. 

3.5 What is white pepper?

   According to Pruthi [2], there are several methods to prepare it: 

    1. Water steeping and rotting technique 
          + From ripening fresh berries. It is the oldest method. Fresh
            berries are harvested when one or two berries start turning
            yellow or red. There are submerged for several days, at the
            eleventh the skin is removed by hand or mechanical methods.
            The berries --without skin-- are washed and immerse in a
            bleaching solution. After 2 days, then they are washed and
            dried. 
          + From dried berries. Pepper berries are dried for 7 to 10
            days, then submerged for one or two weeks. Again they are
            washed, bleached, washed and dried. 
    2. Steaming. Ripening green berries are steamed for 10 to 15 minutes,
       then a machine removes the skin. Also, the berries are treated
       with a bleaching solution, then washed and dried. 
    3. Decortication technique (also known as decorticated pepper) .
       Created by decortication machines that remove the skin of the
       dried black peppercorns. 

3.6 Are there any differences between white and black pepper?

   The only significant difference between white and black pepper is in
   starch and fiber content. The belief that white pepper is milder in
   flavour than black pepper does not seem to be confirmed by the
   scientific data [2]. However, there are some differences in pungency
   --of black and white pepper-- due to geographical origin. 

3.7 Storage

   Pepper can be washed and re-dried before grinding. Store away from
   sunlight at moderate temperatures and low humidity. Only grinded
   pepper needs to be stored in sealed containers. 

   Pepper loses more volatile oils the finer it is grinded. 

4 CINNAMON

   Dried bark of Cinnamomum verum (syn. C. zeylanicm). 

4.1 Where does Cinnamon come from?

   It is indigenous in Sri Lanka, which still produces the largest
   quantity and best quality. Seychelles is the second largest producer. 

5 VANILLA

   Vanilla is the fully grown fruit of the orchid Vanilla fragrans
   harvested before it is fully ripe; then it is fermented and cured. The
   fruits are usually referred to as vanilla beans [4]. Vanilla
   production is regulated by ISO standard 5565. 

5.1 Where does Vanilla come from?

   Vanilla is native to Mexico, Guatemala and other parts of Central
   America. At the present time, it grows also in Madagascar, the
   Seychelles, Tahiti, Riunion and other tropical areas[5]. The first
   recorded use of the spice in European literature dates back to 1520,
   when Moctezuma II offered vanilla flavoured chocolate to Hernan
   Cortis. However, the use of tlilxochitl (Nahuatl for vanilla) is
   earlier documented in the precolumbian literature. 

5.2 What is Vanillin?

   Vanillin is a crystalline phenolic aldehyde C_8H_8O_3 that is the
   chief fragrant component of vanilla and is used especially in
   flavouring and in perfumery [6]. 

   Vanillin can now be produced synthetically, and it is much cheaper
   than natural vanilla. 

5.3 Products

  5.3.1 WHAT IS VANILLA EXTRACT?

     Vanilla extract is obtained by macerating the cured beans in a
   solution of water and alcohol. It might contain sugar or glycerine as
   sweeteners or thickeners [4]. 

   Conventional vanilla extracts have a minimum ethanol content of 35%,
   and contain the soluble extractives from 1 part by weight of vanilla
   beans in 10 parts by volume of hydroalcoholic solution. [4]. 

  5.3.2 HOW DO I DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN REAL AND UNREAL VANILLA EXTRACT?

   ``The two best indicators of pure vanilla extract are alcohol content
   and price. The alcohol content must be at least 35%; synthetics
   usually have no alcohol or at most, about 2%. Any purchases that cost
   less than US$25.00 a quart are most likely synthetic.''[7] 

  5.3.3 WHAT IS VANILLA FLAVOURING?

     It is similar to vanilla extract (see 5.3.1) but contains less than
   35% of ethanol per volume. 

  5.3.4 WHAT IS VANILLA TINCTURE?

   It is used exclusively in pharmaceutical applications. It is prepared
   by maceration from 1 part of vanilla beans by weight to 10 parts of
   hydroalcoholic solution and contains added sugar. It differs from
   vanilla extract (see 5.3.1) by having at least a 38% ethanol content. 

  5.3.5 WHAT IS CONCENTRATED VANILLA EXTRACT AND CONCENTRATED VANILLA
  FLAVOURING?

   They are prepared by removing the solvent from their regular
   counterparts (see 5.3.1, 5.3.3). 

  5.3.6 WHAT IS VANILLA OLEORESIN?

   It is a semi-solid concentrate obtained by removing the solvent from
   the vanilla extract. A solution of isopropanol is frequently used
   instead of ethanol for the maceration. Vanilla oleoresin has lost part
   of its aroma --hence its flavour-- during the removal of the solvent. 

  5.3.7 WHAT IS VANILLA POWDER?

     Powdered vanilla beans. It might be pure, but normally it is
   adulterated with vanilla oleoresin, sugar, food starch, or gum acacia.

  5.3.8 WHAT IS VANILLA-VANILLIN EXTRACT FLAVOURING AND POWDER?

   A combination of synthetic vanillin and vanilla oleoresin to create
   extract and flavouring (see 5.3.1, 5.3.3, 5.3.7). 

  5.3.9 WHAT IS PERFUMERY VANILLA TINCTURE?

   Similar to vanilla extract (see 5.3.1) but prepared with perfumery
   alcohol, with near 90% ethanol content. It is not intended for
   consumption. 

  5.3.10 WHAT IS VANILLA ABSOLUTE?

   It is the most concentrated form of vanilla. ``It is 7-13 times
   stronger than good-quality vanilla beans but it has less well-rounded
   character'' [4]. 

5.4 Major types of Vanilla

  5.4.1 WHAT ARE VANILLA SPLITS?

   Whole bean that burst open during fermentation, and are frosted with
   vanillin crystals [8]. 

  5.4.2 WHAT ARE VANILLA CUTS?

   Beans that have been cut into pieces to accelerate the curing process.
   This category might include small beans. 

  5.4.3 WHAT IS MEXICAN VANILLA?

   It is supplied in 5 grades (or 7 if intermediate grades are included)
   of whole beans and in the form of cuts. The top grades of Mexican
   beans are rarely ``frosted'' with a surface coating of naturally
   exuded vanillin.[4] 

  5.4.4 WHAT IS BOURBON VANILLA?

   ``It has a deeper `body' flavour than Mexican vanilla, but less fine
   aroma'' [4]. It is produced in Madagascar, the Comoro Islands and
   Riunion. 

  5.4.5 WHAT IS INDONESIAN VANILLA?

   The main source of Indonesian vanilla is Java. ``Java vanilla
   possesses a deep, full-bodied flavour and is frequently used for
   blending with synthetic vanillin'' [4] 

  5.4.6 WHAT IS SOUTH AMERICAN OR WEST INDIAN VANILLA?

   More similar in properties to Bourbon than to Mexican vanilla. 

  5.4.7 WHAT IS TAHITI VANILLA?

   It is obtained from V. tahitensis and ``possesses a characteristic
   aromatic odour and usually has a lower vanillin content than true
   vanilla.'' [4]. It generally has less flavour than true vanilla. 

  5.4.8 WHAT IS VANILLONS (GUADELOUPE VANILLA OR ANTILLES VANILLA)?

   It is obtained from V. pompona. ``Vanillons has a low vanillin content
   and possesses a characteristic floral aroma, bearing similarities to
   Tahiti vanilla'' [4]. It has a poor flavour and it is normally used in
   perfumery. 

5.5 For the do-it-yourselfer

  5.5.1 HOW DO I PREPARE VANILLA EXTRACT?

   Juan San Mames shared the following recipe [9]: 

     Use one vanilla bean for every 120 ml. of any clear liquor (vodka
     preferably). With a knife, split the bean open (always put your
     finger behind the knife). If the bean is hard, just break it into
     pieces. Then put the bean in the liquor. 

     Close the bottle and leave it for about two weeks or until the
     vanilla bean aroma begins to come through. 

     When you use the extract, if you don't want the vanilla seeds to
     show with the ingredients, use a coffee filter. You can return the
     seeds to the bottle. If you make ice cream, you may want to show
     the seeds in the finished ice cream. 

   Bruce Steinberg added [10]: 

     You can shake the bottle several times a week to accelerate the
     extraction. Brandy may also be used for interesting variations. 

   According to US regulations, 1 l. of vanilla extract must contain a
   minimum of 100 gr. of vanilla beans (I reckon that each regular size
   complete bean must weight between 3 and 5 gr.) of no more or 25%
   moisture content. Commercial extracts also include sugar and
   glycerine, to help to ``fix'' the aroma [4]. 

  5.5.2 HOW DO I PREPARE VANILLA SUGAR?

   Store 1 or 2 vanilla beans on an air-tight jar of granulated sugar.
   Allow one month for the flavour to permeate. If the beans are always
   topped with sugar, the beans last for years. Use this sugar in sweet
   dishes.[5] 

   Storage temperature can be raised to 15-21 ^OC without detriment to
   the flavour quality of the beans.[4] 

  5.5.3 HOW DO I STORE MY CURED VANILLA BEANS?

   Vanilla beans should be stored in open containers at a temperature of
   about 10 C at a low humidity [11] 

  5.5.4 HOW DO I USE VANILLA IN MY KITCHEN?

   Use vanilla sugar to give a nice flavour to your drinks. It also
   enhances the flavour of chocolate [5]. 

   Almost any sweet dish will improve its flavour with a touch of vanilla
   extract. 

5.6 Further information

   An excellent treatment of the topic can be found at [4]. 

   The Vanilla Information Hotline is available at 408/457-0902 (or fax
   at 408/457-2521) for any vanilla questions, to request a basic vanilla
   FAQ (by fax or snail mail), or to get further info on ordering

6 SAFFRON

6.1 What is saffron?

   Saffron is the dried stigmas of the crocus sativus. It is of orange
   color and has a strong perfume and a bitter taste. Saffron production
   is regulated by ISO with standard 3632. 

6.2 Why is saffron so expensive?

   Every plant has on average 3 flowers; each flower only 3 stigmas. It
   takes between 200,000 and 300,000 stigmas to make 1 kg. of saffron
   [5]. Pure saffron, however, has a strong flavour and a pinch is
   sufficient for most dishes. 

   Avoid buying powered saffron, it might be adulterated. 

6.3 Why should I not use wooden utensils to work with saffron?

   Wood has an absorbing property. Since saffron is expensive you don't
   want to waste it. 

6.4 What is Mexican saffron?

   Mexican saffron is the flower of Carthamus tinctorius L. which is an
   annual herb grown in the temperate regions of Central Mixico. Its
   quality is quite inferior to real saffron but it has similar coloring
   properties. It is far cheaper. 

6.5 How do I store saffron?

   Saffron is sensitive to light and moisture. Keep it in a dark
   container away from sunlight. 

6.6 Where is saffron native from?

   It is believed that it is native of both Greece, and Asia Minor. 

6.7 Further information

   Vanilla, Saffron Imports prints a pamphlet called Cooking and & with
   Saffron, they also have a WWW page ( http://www.saffron.com/
    ) with some facts about saffron, including a
   photospectrometry report. They can be reached at ``Vanilla Saffron
   Imports, 949 Valencia Street, San Francisco, CA 94110''. 

7 WHAT IS CORIANDER/CILANTRO/CHINESE PARSLEY?

   Coriander is the common name for coriandrum sativum (fam.
   umbelliferae). It is an annual plant similar to parsley. It has erect,
   furrowed solid, branched stems. The alternate bright green leaves are
   pinnate or bipinnate, the lower ones are broader leaflets than the
   upper ones, which are finely divided. Coriander seeds are cream to
   brown spheres of 1-1.5 mm. in diameter. In the culinary argot, it is
   common to refer to the plant as cilantro and to the seeds as
   coriander. 

7.1 How do I store cilantro?

   Different people have suggested different methods. Here is a list of
   the most common ones. 

     * ``bouquet'' in the fridge. Cover loosely with plastic. 
     * ``bouquet'' in the window. 
     * ``airtight container'' in the fridge. 
     * ``wrapping'' in damp towels, inside a plastic bag. 

   Sophie Laplante (sophie@cs.uchicago.edu) performed some experiments on
   these different methods for storing cilantro. She found that the
   airtight container seemed to keep it edible[sic] for the longest time
   (3 weeks). 

8 OTHER SPICES

8.1 Is there any substitute to coconut milk?

   You can probably find coconut milk in an Asian store, either in liquid
   or powdered form. If you have no other choice, you can follow this
   recipe [12]: 

     * Take a handful of shredded coconut and pack it in the bottom of a
       bowl. 
     * Pour boiling (and I mean a really boiling) water just to cover
       the packed coconut and let stand until the water is cool. 
     * Strain the coconut shreds and press them in the bottom of the
       strainer get as much liquid as possible. 

     The liquid is very close to coconut milk and will impart the flavor
     very well. 

9 STORING SPICES

9.1 Bay leaves

   Bay leaves lose approximately 30% of their volatile oil and 40-60% of
   their chlorophyll during one year of storage. A good way to evaluate
   the quality of the leaf is to determine how bright its color is. 

9.2 Ground spices

   Ground spices, whith greater surface exposed, tend to lose their
   volatile oils. They also deteriorate faster than whole spices. 

   The needs for packaging vary from spice to spice. In general, follow
   the next guidelines: 

     * Use dark, air tight containers. 
     * Fill the container as much as you can. 
     * Avoid buying ground spices. Grind them yourself using a mortar.
