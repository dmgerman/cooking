\section{Spices}

\subsection{What are spices}
D 3
To be written...
E 3

I 3
Spices are the various strongly flavoured or aromatic substances of
vegetable origin, commonly used as condiments or employed for other
purposes on account of their fragance and preservation qualities
\cite{oed}.

E 3
\subsection{Why are spices so tasty?}
Spices have two main components \cite{Pruthi}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Volatile oils. Also known as essential oils, they are
  responsible for the characteristic aroma of spices.
D 3
\item Oleoresins. Or non volatile extracts, which are responsible for

\subsection{What are some uses of spices (excluding the kitchen)}

I 3
Some examples on the use of spices:

E 3
\begin{itemize}
\item Antioxygenic properties. Some spices retard the oxydation of
  fat.
\item Preserving action. 
D 3
  Some oils contain essential oils that are toxic to microorganisms. 
%For example\cite{Pruthi},
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item Cloves contain plenty of essential oil (15 to 20\%); its main
%    component --eugenol, 80 to 92\%-- inhibits the growth of
%    microorganisms.
%  \item At normal grothw temperatures, the mustard's essential oil is
%    toxic to microorganism.
%  \end{itemize}

%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item Stimulation of salivary flow and amylasis (the promotion of
%    the growth of amylase --any of the enzymes (as amylopsin) that
%    accelerate the hydrolysis of starch and glycogen or their
%    intermediate hydrolysis products). Some spices, when added to food,
%    promote increased, salivation compared to unspiced food. Citric
%    acid, acetic acid, and tartaric acid are the best promoters,
%    followed by the biting spices --capsicums (chili), ginger,
%    pepper \cite{Pruthi}.
%%  \item Stimulation of gastric secretion.  It is debatable whether
%    pations with peptic ulcer should avoid spices. Several studies
%    show that it promotes gastric secretion
%  \end{itemize}
\item Perfumery and cosmetics. 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Oils from cardamon, cumin, celery, chive, juniper, and nutmeg
    are used in different types of perfume \cite{Pruthi}.
  \item The oil of cinnamon, dill seed, fennel seed, and nutmeg are
    used in scenting soaps, dental preparations, hair lotions, and
    others \cite{Pruthi}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Pepper}

I 3
\begin{rawhtml}

\end{rawhtml}


E 3
\subsection{What is black pepper?}

Black pepper is the whole dried immature fruit of the {\em Piper
  nigrum}.

\subsection{Where is pepper native from?}

It is native of the Western Ghats in India, where it is still
restricted as a wild plant. Nowadays, it can also be found growing
wild in north Burma and the hills of Assam.

\subsection{Where the name pepper comes from}

It is believed that the name comes from the Sanskrit {\em pippali},
which was the name of the long pepper, {\em P. longum}, which is
now never seen in Europe.

D 3
\subsection{Are there any differences between white and black pepper?}
E 3

D 3
The only significant difference between white and black pepper is in
starch and fiber content. {\em The belief that white pepper is milder
  in flavour than black pepper does not seem to be confirmed by the
  scientific data\/} \cite{Pruthi}. However, there are some
differences in pungency --of black and white pepper-- due to
geographical origin.

\subsection{Storage}

Pepper can be washed and re-dried before grinding. Store away from
sunlight at moderate temperatures and low humidity. Only grinded
pepper needs to be stored in sealed containers.

Pepper loses more volatile oils the finer it is grinded.

E 3
\subsection{What is green pepper?}

It is unripe, but fully developed, pepper which is artificially dried
or preserved in ``wet'' form, e.g. brine, vinegar, citric acid.

\subsection{What is white pepper?}

I 3
\begin{rawhtml}
  <img src="/cgi-bin/dmg/images/spices/whipepc_16.gif"><p>
\end{rawhtml}

E 3
According to Pruthi \cite{Pruthi}, there are several methods to prepare it:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Water steeping and rotting technique
  \begin{itemize}
D 3
  \item From ripening fresh berrites. It is the oldest method. Fresh
E 3
I 3
  \item From ripening fresh berries. It is the oldest method. Fresh
E 3
    berries are harvested when one or two berries start turning yellow
    or red. There are submerged for several days, at the eleventh the
    skin is removed by hand or mechanical methods. The berries
    --without skin-- are washed and immerse in a bleaching solution.
    After 2 days, then they are washed and dried.
  \item From dried berries. Pepper berries are dried for 7 to 10 days,
    then submerged for one or two weeks. Again they are washed,
    bleached, washed and dried.
  \end{itemize}
D 3
\item Steaming. Ripening green berries are steemed for 10 to 15
E 3
I 3
\item Steaming. Ripening green berries are steamed for 10 to 15

  minutes, then a machine removes the skin. Also, the berries are
  treated with a bleaching solution, then washed and dried.
%\item Chemical technique. Joshi patented the following method:
%  \begin{enumerate}
%  \item dried black berries are immerse in five times its weight of
%    water for 4 days
%  \item treated with 4\% NaOH solution and boiling the mixture
%  \item removing the skins by stirring at 1600 r.p.m.
%  \item bleaching with $H_2O_2$
%  \item drying the berries at 125 F.
%  \end{enumerate}
\item Decortication technique (also known as \textsl{decorticated
    pepper}) . Created by decortication machines that remove the skin
  of the dried black peppercorns. 
\end{enumerate}

E 3
Dried bark of {\em Cinnamomum verum} (syn. {\em C. zeylanicm}).

\subsection{Where does Cinnamon come from?}
It is indigenous in Sri Lanka, which still produces the largest
quantity and best quality. Seychelles is the second largest producer.

\section{Vanilla}
I 3
\begin{rawhtml}
  <img src="/cgi-bin/dmg/images/spices/vanilla_16.gif"><p>
\end{rawhtml}

E 3
Vanilla is the fully grown fruit of the orchid {\em Vanilla
  fragrans\/} %and {\em Vanilla planifolia\/}
harvested before it is fully ripe; then it is fermented and cured. The
fruits are usually referred to as vanilla beans \cite{Purseglove-2}.
Vanilla production is regulated by ISO standard 5565.

\subsection{Where does Vanilla come from?}
Vanilla is native to Mexico, Guatemala and other parts of Central
America. At the present time, it grows also in Madagascar, the
Seychelles, Tahiti, Réunion and other tropical areas\cite{Mulherin}.
The first recorded use of the spice in European literature dates back
to 1520, when Moctezuma II offered vanilla flavoured chocolate to
Hernán Cortés. However, the use of {\em tlilxochitl\/} (Nahuatl for
vanilla) is earlier documented in the precolumbian literature.

\subsection{What is Vanillin?}
Vanillin is a crystalline phenolic aldehyde $C_8H_8O_3$ that is the
chief fragrant component of vanilla and is used especially in flavouring and
in perfumery \cite{Webster}.

Vanillin can now be produced synthetically, and it is much cheaper
than natural vanilla.

\subsection{Products}

\subsubsection{What is Vanilla Extract?}
\label{vanilla-extract}
Vanilla extract is obtained by macerating the cured beans in a
solution of water and alcohol. It might contain sugar or glycerine as
sweeteners or thickeners \cite{Purseglove-2}.

Conventional vanilla extracts have a minimum ethanol content of 35\%,
and contain the soluble extractives from 1 part by weight of vanilla
beans in 10 parts by volume of hydroalcoholic solution.
\cite{Purseglove-2}.

\subsubsection{How do I differentiate between real and unreal vanilla
  extract?}

``The two best indicators of pure vanilla extract are alcohol content
and price.  The alcohol content must be at least 35\%; synthetics
usually have no alcohol or at most, about 2\%. Any purchases that cost
less than US\$25.00 a quart are most likely
synthetic.''\cite{patricia-rain}


\subsubsection{What is vanilla flavouring?}
\label{vanilla-flavouring}
It is similar to vanilla extract (see \ref{vanilla-extract}) but
contains less than 35\% of ethanol per volume.

\subsubsection{What is vanilla tincture?}
It is used exclusively in pharmaceutical applications. It is prepared
by maceration from 1 part of vanilla beans by weight to 10 parts of
hydroalcoholic solution and contains added sugar. It differs from
vanilla extract (see \ref{vanilla-extract}) by having at least a 38\%
ethanol content.

\subsubsection{What is concentrated vanilla extract and concentrated vanilla
  flavouring?} 
They are prepared by removing the solvent from their
regular counterparts (see \ref{vanilla-extract},
\ref{vanilla-flavouring}).

\subsubsection{What is Vanilla Oleoresin?}
It is a semi-solid concentrate obtained by removing the solvent from
the vanilla extract. A solution of isopropanol is frequently used
instead of ethanol for the maceration. Vanilla oleoresin has lost 
part of its aroma --hence its flavour-- during the removal of the
solvent.

\subsubsection{What is Vanilla Powder?}
\label{vanilla-powder}
Powdered vanilla beans. It might be pure, but normally it is
adulterated with vanilla oleoresin, sugar, food starch, or gum acacia.

\subsubsection{What is Vanilla-Vanillin Extract Flavouring and Powder?}
A combination of synthetic vanillin and vanilla oleoresin to create
extract and flavouring (see \ref{vanilla-extract},
\ref{vanilla-flavouring}, \ref{vanilla-powder}).

\subsubsection{What is Perfumery Vanilla Tincture?}
Similar to vanilla extract (see \ref{vanilla-extract}) but prepared
with perfumery alcohol, with near 90\% ethanol content. It is not
intended for consumption.

\subsubsection{What is Vanilla Absolute?}
It is the most concentrated form of vanilla. ``It is 7-13 times stronger
than good-quality vanilla beans but it has less well-rounded
character'' \cite{Purseglove-2}.

\subsection{Major types of Vanilla}

\subsubsection{What are vanilla splits?}
Whole bean that burst open during fermentation, and are frosted with
vanillin crystals \cite{Andy}.

\subsubsection{What are vanilla cuts?}
Beans that have been cut into pieces to accelerate the curing
process. This category might include small beans.

\subsubsection{What is Mexican Vanilla?}
%``Mexico has been regarded has the supplier of the vanilla with the
%finest aroma and flavour'' \cite{Purseglove-2} (please notice that it . 
It is supplied in 5 grades (or 7 if intermediate grades are included)
of whole beans and in the form of cuts. The top grades of Mexican
beans are rarely ``frosted'' with a surface coating of naturally
exuded vanillin.\cite{Purseglove-2}

\subsubsection{What is Bourbon vanilla?}
``It has a deeper `body' flavour than Mexican vanilla, but less fine
aroma'' \cite{Purseglove-2}. It is produced in Madagascar, the Comoro
Islands and Réunion.

\subsubsection{What is Indonesian vanilla?}
The main source of Indonesian vanilla is Java. ``Java vanilla possesses
a deep, full-bodied flavour and is frequently used for blending with
synthetic vanillin'' \cite{Purseglove-2}

\subsubsection{What is South American or West Indian Vanilla?}
More similar in properties to Bourbon than to Mexican vanilla.

\subsubsection{What is Tahiti vanilla?}
It is obtained from {\em V. tahitensis\/} and ``possesses a
characteristic aromatic odour and usually has a lower vanillin content
than true vanilla.'' \cite{Purseglove-2}. It generally has less
flavour than true vanilla.

\subsubsection{What is Vanillons (Guadeloupe vanilla or Antilles vanilla)?}
It is obtained from {\em V. pompona\/}. ``Vanillons has a low vanillin
content and possesses a characteristic floral aroma, bearing
similarities to Tahiti vanilla'' \cite{Purseglove-2}. It has a poor
flavour and it is normally used in perfumery.

\subsection{For the do-it-yourselfer}

\subsubsection{How do I prepare Vanilla Extract?}

Juan San Mames shared the following recipe \cite{sanmames}:

\begin{quote}
  {\em
Use one vanilla bean for every 120 ml.  of any clear liquor (vodka 
preferably). With a knife, split the bean open  (always put your 
finger behind the knife). If the bean is hard, just break it into pieces. 
Then  put the bean in the liquor.  

Close the bottle and leave it for about two weeks or until the vanilla
bean aroma begins to come through. 

When you use the extract, if you don't want the vanilla seeds to show  
with the ingredients, use a coffee filter. You can return the 
seeds to the bottle.  If you make ice cream, you may want to show the 
seeds in the finished ice cream.}

\end{quote}

Bruce Steinberg added \cite{bruce}:

\begin{quote}
{\em
You can shake the bottle several times a week to accelerate the
extraction. Brandy may also be used for interesting variations.}
\end{quote}

According to US regulations, 1 l. of vanilla extract must contain a
minimum of 100 gr. of vanilla beans (I reckon that each
  regular size complete bean must weight between 3 and 5 gr.) of no
more or 25\% moisture content. Commercial extracts also include sugar
and glycerine, to help to ``fix'' the aroma \cite{Purseglove-2}.

\subsubsection{How do I prepare vanilla sugar?}
Store 1 or 2 vanilla beans on an air-tight jar of granulated
sugar. Allow one month for the flavour to permeate. If the beans are
always topped with sugar, the beans last for years. Use this sugar in
sweet dishes.\cite{Mulherin}

Storage temperature can be raised to 15-21 $^O$C without detriment to
the flavour quality of the beans.\cite{Purseglove-2}

\subsubsection{How do I store my cured vanilla beans?}
Vanilla beans should be stored in open containers at a temperature of
about 10 C at a low humidity \cite{merory-56}

\subsubsection{How do I use vanilla in my kitchen?}
Use vanilla sugar to give a nice flavour to your drinks. It also
enhances the flavour of chocolate \cite{Mulherin}.

Almost any sweet dish will improve its flavour with a touch of vanilla
extract.

\subsection{Further information}
An excellent treatment of the topic can be found at
\cite{Purseglove-2}. 

%%Patricia Rain's {\em "The Vanilla Cookbook"\/} covers the use of
%%vanilla in everything from basic extracts through liqueurs, desserts,
%%souffles, and baking of all kinds, to full-tilt savoury recipes such
%%as "Seafood-Pecan Salad with Vanilla Mayonnaise," "Rice with Coconut,
%%Vanilla, Dates, and Lemon" and "Fresh Tuna Grenobleoise with
%%Vanilla" \cite{bruce}.

(or fax at 408/457-2521) for any vanilla questions, to request a
basic vanilla FAQ (by fax or snail mail), or to get further info on
ordering Tahitian and Bourbon beans, extracts, or "The Vanilla
Cookbook" itself.

\section{Saffron}

\subsection{What is saffron?}
Saffron is the dried stigmas of the crocus sativus.  It is of orange
color and has a strong perfume and a bitter taste.  Saffron production
is regulated by ISO with standard 3632.

%Spain is one of the biggest growers of saffron in the world. Spanish
%saffron is divided into three categories: Mancha, Rio, Sierra-- Mancha
%being the best.  There is a better quality called Coupe (Short), but
%it is hard to find because of its limited production. Iran is also a
%big producer, but because of the embargo its saffron is not available
%in the US. Iranian #1 qualiti is usually all red, ant it looks like
%little arrow heads. Again, it is illegal to import it.  Basically, all
%saffrons are the same.  They all come from the Crocus Sativus, with
%slight variations in the countries where they are grown.  The
%selection of the saffron is what is most important.  The best Spanish
%saffron is the one that shows the ISO-3632 norm on the label,.  ISO is
%the International Standards Organization, based in Switzerland.  Spain
%is one of the subscribers to this organization.

\subsection{Why is saffron so expensive?}
Every plant has on average 3 flowers; each flower only 3 stigmas.  It
D 3
takes between 200,000 and 300,000 stigmas to make 1 kg. of
saffron \cite{Mulherin}. However, pure saffron has a strong flavour, and
a pinch is sufficient for most dishes. For instance, one ounce of
saffron will be sufficient to give aroma and flavour to 907/4 cups of
dry rice.%\cite{saffron-faq}

E 3
Avoid buying powered saffron, it might be adulterated.

\subsection{Why should I not use wooden utensils to work with
  saffron?}
Wood has an absorbing property. Since saffron is expensive you don't
want to waste it.

\subsection{What is Mexican saffron?}
Mexican saffron is the flower of {\em Carthamus tinctorius L. \/}
D 3
which is
an annual herb grown in the temperate regions of Central México. Its
quality is quite inferior to real saffron but it has similar coloring
properties. It is far cheaper.

\subsection{How do I store saffron?}
Saffron is sensitive to light and moisture. Keep it in a dark
container away from sunlight.

\subsection{Where is saffron native from?}
It is believed that it is native of both Greece, and Asia Minor.

\section{What is coriander/cilantro/Chinese parsley?}
Cilantro is the common name for coriandrum sativum (fam.
umbelliferae). It is an annual plant similar to parsley. It has
erect, furrowed solid, branched stems. The alternate bright green
leaves are pinnate or bipinnate, the lower ones are broader leaflets
than the upper ones, which are finely divided.
Cilantro seeds are cream to brown spheres of 1-1.5 mm. in diameter. 

\subsection{How do I store cilantro?}
Different people have suggested different methods. Here is a list of
the most common ones.

\begin{itemize}
\item ``bouquet'' in the fridge. Cover loosely with plastic. 
\item ``bouquet'' in the window.
\item ``airtight container'' in the fridge. 
\item ``wrapping'' in damp towels, inside a plastic bag.
\end{itemize}

Sophie Laplante (sophie@cs.uchicago.edu) performed some experiments
on these different methods for storing cilantro. She found that the
airtight container seemed to keep it {\em edible\/}[sic] for the
longest time (3 weeks).

\subsection{Is there any substitute to coconut milk?}

You can probably find coconut milk in an Asian store, either in liquid
or powdered form. If you have no other choice, you can follow this
recipe \cite{ashall}:

\begin{quote}
  {\em
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Take a handful of shredded coconut and pack it in the bottom of
      a bowl.
    \item Pour boiling (and I mean a really boiling) water just to cover the packed
      coconut and let stand until the water is cool.
    \item  Strain the coconut shreds
      and press them in the bottom of the strainer get as much liquid as possible.
    \end{itemize}
    The liquid is very close to coconut milk and will impart the flavor
    very well.
    }
\end{quote}

\section{Storing Spices}

\subsection{Bay leaves}
Bay leaves lose approximately 30\% of their volatile oil and 40-60\%
of their chlorophyll during one year of storage.  A good way to
evaluate the quality of the leaf is to determine how bright its color
is.

\subsection{Ground spices}
Ground spices, whith greater surface exposed, tend to lose their
volatile oils. They also deteriorate faster than whole spices.

The needs for packaging vary  from spice to spice. In general, follow
the next guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
\item Use dark, air tight containers.
\item Fill the container as much as you can.
\item Avoid buying ground spices. Grind them yourself using a
  mortar.
\end{itemize}
